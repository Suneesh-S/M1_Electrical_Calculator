# Requirements
## Introduction
 * Electrical Calculator is a conversion calculator provide a one-stop resource for numerous computations in the electronics industry. Whether you're looking for a 4 band resistor or seeking to figure out how long a battery lasts, this electrical calculator can assist. 
 * This project first takes the user to a index page where the available contents on type of calculator are listed and asks the user to give input for the respective topic he wants to calculate. User can also try run the example code by him/herself. User can also give suggestion to us. 

## Research
### E-BOOK ON C PROGRAMMING...
* This is a simple project which simply provide easy contents on c programming to the user after taking input from the user. 
* This project is built using traditional file handling system rather than Data base system. here the user provides his/her desired choice and the code after taking input from the user it runs the respective user defined funtion which prints the contents of the respective topic.

## Cost and Features
* This project has various features, like it can provide contents on c programming concepts to the user. 
* User can also run the given sample codes and try it by themslef. which is a big plus point for this project.
* users have option also option to give their valuable suggestions in or platform. 
#### above features are shown in the below screenshot.

## Defining Our System
* System bacically takes input from the user and checks for the file, and then it prints the file.
for ruunig the code it checks for the available code and run it in the compiler i.e GCC and prints the output
* for the suggestion part it takes suggestion from user and stores it in a file.
