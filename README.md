## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. During valgrind check, online resources helped a lot. 
2. as most of the the functions required different types of functions, geeks for geeks websites helps a lot
3. while running the multiple files. Make file helped a lot to resolve this.
4. over all stack overflow helped a lot in resolving issues during this project.
5. DgiKey website helps to design the overall Calculator project.
